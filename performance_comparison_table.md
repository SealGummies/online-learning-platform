## Execution Plan Comparison

| Aspect | With Indexes | Without Indexes |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Scan Type** | IXSCAN (Index Scan) | COLLSCAN (Collection Scan) |
| **Documents Examined** | 0 (index only) | 25-150 (full collection) |
| **Memory Usage** | Low (index lookup) | High (full scan) |
| **Scalability** | Excellent | Poor (linear degradation) |
| **Sort Performance** | Fast (indexed sort) | Slow (in-memory sort) |

## Recommendations

1. **Critical Indexes**: Maintain indexes on frequently queried fields
2. **Text Indexes**: Essential for search functionality
3. **Compound Indexes**: Optimize multi-field queries
4. **Monitoring**: Track query performance as data grows
5. **Index Maintenance**: Regular index analysis and optimization
